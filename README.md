# RollNES

<br>


The RollNES site consists of games released for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is possible to play these games in a browser. I created the emulator (called RollNES) myself using JavaScript. The emulator can be found in my <i><b>nes-emulator</b></i> project here on GitHub. React was used to create the site.
