/**
 * The 2A03 contains a pair of DMA units, one for copying sprite data to PPU OAM and the other for copying DPCM sample
 * data to the APU's DMC sample buffer. DMA is required for DPCM playback, and it is difficult to fill OAM without DMA.
 * The OAM DMA is the only effective method for initializing all 256 bytes of OAM. Because of the decay of OAM's dynamic
 * RAM when rendering is disabled, the initialization should take place within vblank. Writes through OAMDATA are
 * generally too slow for this task.
 *
 * This is the DMA (Direct Memory Access) unit for copying sprite data to the PPU OAM. OAM DMA copies 256 bytes from a
 * CPU page to PPU OAM via the OAMDATA ($2004) register. OAM DMA will copy from the page most recently written to $4014.
