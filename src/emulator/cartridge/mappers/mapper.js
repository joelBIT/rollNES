/**
 * A Mapper takes the incoming addresses from both buses and transform them to the correct memory location on
 * the Cartridge. Thus, the CPU is oblivious to the data it is reading and writing. The same goes for the PPU.
 *
 * NES games come in cartridges, and inside of those cartridges are various circuits and hardware. Different games use
 * different circuits and hardware, and the configuration and capabilities of such cartridges is commonly called
 * their mapper. Mappers are designed to extend the system and bypass its limitations, such as by adding RAM to the
 * cartridge or even extra sound channels.
 *
 * The programBanks and characterBanks variables contains the number of chunks (each program chunk corresponds to 16kb
 * of data, and each character chunk corresponds to 8kb of data) a loaded game consists of.
 *
 * The program memory is an array containing program data and the character memory is an array containing character data.
 * This data can be logically divided into 'banks', which are logical segments of the array. By using the constants in
 * this class the program data and the character data can be divided into segments of desired sizes without affecting the
 * original array.
